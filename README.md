# FakeJSONPlaceholder

This is a project just to create an url to get a simple json. The goal is simulate an API call to use it in an app.

I followed [this medium post](https://medium.com/@royanimesh2211/create-a-free-fake-rest-api-with-json-server-running-on-the-internet-30a627c7c20d) to create it.
